### Some Note
- Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

- In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign
- Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
- A variable name cannot start with a number

1. Variable
- just take a variable and print out.
- In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.

2. PHP Global Variable
- we see if we use the global function out put will be "15"
- or only if we print $y out-put will be '10' in that example.

3. Gloval variable in array
- PHP also stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index]
- we see if we use the global array function out put will be "15"
- or only if we print $y out-put will be 10
